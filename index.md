### CPSC 120
* Lab 5
    Lab 5 part 1 was a favorite because I always really enjoyed doing Mad Libs. The fact that I can now create my own mad libs story is exciting and allows me to express my humor is other ways. I learned to reject command-line arguments if they was not a valid amount and to create meaningful outputs based on the user's input.
* Lab 7 
    Lab 7 part 2 was a favorite because I always liked playing blackjack. This activity allowed me to dissect each aspect of blackjack, like if each card name argument was a valid or if the total score was a bust.
