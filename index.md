### CPSC 120
#### * Lab 5 Part 1
Lab 5 part 1 was a favorite because I always really enjoyed doing Mad Libs. The fact that I can now create my own mad libs story is exciting and allows me to express my humor is other ways. I learned to reject command-line arguments if they was not a valid amount and to create meaningful outputs based on the user's input.
#### * Lab 7 Part 1
Lab 7 part 1 was a favorite because the game we created was a simple and engaging game that made the user test their logic. So within 2 rounds, the player can either win or lose based on if their guessed number was too high, too low, or exactly the secret number.
#### * Lab 7 Part 2
Lab 7 part 2 was a favorite because I always liked playing blackjack. This activity allowed me to dissect each aspect of blackjack, like if each card name argument was a valid or if the total score was a bust.
