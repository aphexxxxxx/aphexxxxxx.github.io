### CPSC 120
* Lab 5
Lab 5, Part 1 was a favorite because I always really enjoyed doing Mad Libs. The fact that I can now create my own mad libs story is exciting and allows me to express my humor is other ways. I learned to reject command-line arguments if they weren't valid and to create meaningful outputs based on the user's input.
