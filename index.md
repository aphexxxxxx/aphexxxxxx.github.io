### CPSC 120
#### * Lab 5 Part 1
Lab 5 part 1 was a favorite because I always enjoyed doing Mad Libs. The fact that I can now create my own mad libs story is exciting and allows me to express my humor in other ways. I learned to reject command-line arguments if they were not a valid amount and to create meaningful outputs based on the user's input.
#### * Lab 7 Part 1
Lab 7 part 1 was a favorite because the game we created was simple and engaging, making the user test their logic. So within two rounds, the player can either win or lose based on if their guessed number was too high, too low, or exactly the secret number. I learned to consider all possible scenarios by implementing loops and conditional statements.
#### * Lab 7 Part 2
Lab 7 part 2 was a favorite because I always liked playing blackjack. This activity allowed me to dissect each aspect of blackjack, like if each card name argument was valid or the total score was a bust. I learned more about the composition of multiple functions like IsCardName, calling the other functions to determine if the card name was valid.
